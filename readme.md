## About [En2::Web](https://en2ynu.com)

En2::Web is a web application for En2 members, which is a student organizaion of Yokohama National University. This application is designed for efficient information sharing in daily activities and accumulating knowledge of each users. This is based on Laravel and Vue.js. It also provides user-friendly services by high integration with other common web applications, like Google API, Slack API, and LINE Messenging API. En2::Web mainly has following functions:

### Notes
En2 users can freely read and post notes about their activities. We have plenty of reports for studying abroad because most of En2 members go overseas to study and get international experience.
### Users
Each members can edit his/her own profile and see others' ones. This makes our communication and mutual understanding much richer.
### Countries
Notes and Users are associated with countries. For example, when you check a page for the U.S., you can see Users who is at /  has been to the U.S. and Notes related to the U.S.
### Calendar
Calendar is integrated with Google Calendar API and LINE Messaging API. Members can easily add upcoming events and use automatic reminder provided by LINE Bot.
